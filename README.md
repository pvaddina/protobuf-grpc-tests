# Protobuf Tests

Several tests aimed to showcase or test usage of Protobuf. At the moment the focus is mainly for CMake integration and the different ways one can generate the messages from *.proto files. Please look at the tests themselves for details at what they actually do.

Please note that these examples are also integrated with CMake and path to the Protobuf compiler and libraries are hardcoded. So it will not work out of the box.
